# Kdtree

#### This is a generalization of a binary search tree with 2d-coordinates as the keys, which has applications in classifying astronomical objects and speeding up neural networks. The purpose of this design is to support efficient range search of points in a given rectangle and nearest neighbor search of a query point. Each point in the tree subdivides the 2d-plane into rectangles, bounded by their parentâ€™s rectangles. For finding the nearest neighbor of a query point, this method starts at the root and uses recursion to search in both subtrees, pruning off subtrees if it cannot contain a point closer than the shortest distance discovered so far. Pruning off a subtree optimizes the algorithm to be faster by not searching unnecessary subtrees.
